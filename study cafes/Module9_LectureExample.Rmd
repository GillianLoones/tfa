```{r setup, include=FALSE}
if (interactive()) setwd(dirname(rstudioapi::getActiveDocumentContext()$path)) # set working dir to current file location
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE, 
                      cache = TRUE, autodep = TRUE)

## What's in the Star Wars data?

* How many rows and columns does this dataset have?
* What does each row represent?
* What does each column represent?

```{r, message=FALSE}
library(tidyverse)
# ?starwars
glimpse(starwars)
```

A row for each person in the movies. For instance the row for Luke Skywalker is:

```{r, out.width="70%", echo=FALSE}
# knitr::include_graphics("img/luke-skywalker.png") # Image file somewhere on teacher's github. Can't be bothered to find it, not important.
```

## Scatterplot of mass vs. height

```{r out.width="70%"}
ggplot(data = starwars, mapping = aes(x = height, y = mass)) +
  geom_point()
```

Note a warning is issued. Not all characters have height and mass information (hence 28 of them not plotted). You may exclude warnings in chunk output by using option `warning = FALSE`. However, but often it's important to note it.


### Adding labels

The `labs` function can be used to add different labels to the plot.

```{r out.width="70%", warning=FALSE}
ggplot(data = starwars, mapping = aes(x = height, y = mass)) +
  geom_point() +
  labs(title = "Mass vs. height of Starwars characters",
       x = "Height (cm)", y = "Weight (kg)")            
```


### The fat guy

* How would you describe this relationship?
* What other variables would help us understand data points that don't follow the overall trend?
* Who is the not so tall but really chubby character?

```{r}
starwars %>% 
  filter(mass > 500) %>% 
  select(name, height, mass)
```



## Aesthetics

Visual characteristics of plotting can be **mapped to a specific variable** using aesthetics. For instance, the visual characteristics of plotting points are:

- `color`
- `size`
- `shape`
- `alpha` (transparency)

Let us have a look at mass vs. height using gender as color aesthetic:

```{r out.width="70%", warning=FALSE}
ggplot(data = starwars, 
       mapping = aes(x = height, y = mass, color = gender)) +
  geom_point()
```

In general not many girls in star wars. Let us add birth year as size aesthetic:

```{r out.width="70%", warning=FALSE}
ggplot(data = starwars, 
       mapping = aes(x = height, y = mass, color = gender, size = birth_year)) +
  geom_point()
```

Jabba is very old. What about species? We use species as color aesthetic:

```{r, eval=FALSE}
# Your turn - Finish the code
# ggplot(data = starwars, 
#        mapping = ___) +
#   geom_point()

ggplot(data = starwars, aes(x = height, y = mass, color = species)) +
   geom_point()
```


Let's now increase the size of all points **not** based on the values of a variable in the data:

```{r out.width="70%", warning=FALSE}
ggplot(data = starwars, mapping = aes(x = height, y = mass, color = gender)) +
  geom_point(size = 2) 
```

A plot of mass given height with hair color as color aesthetic and using fixed `shape = 0`:

```{r, eval=FALSE}
# Your turn: finish the code
# ggplot(data = starwars, mapping = aes(x = height, y = mass, ___)) +
#   geom_point(___) 

ggplot(data = starwars, mapping = aes(x = height, y = mass, color = hair_color)) +
   geom_point(shape = 0) 
```

**Summary**


- Continuous variables are measured on a continuous scale.
- Discrete variables are measured (or often counted) on a discrete scale.
- Use aesthetics for mapping features of a plot to a variable.
- Define fixed features in the geom outside the `aes` function.

aesthetics | discrete                 | continuous                              
-----------|--------------------------|-----------------------------------------
color      | rainbow of colors        | gradient
size       | discrete steps           | linear mapping between radius and value 
shape      | different shape for each | shouldn't (and doesn't) work


## Faceting

- Smaller plots that display different subsets of the data.
- Useful for exploring conditional relationships and large data.

```{r out.width="80%", warning=FALSE}
ggplot(data = starwars, mapping = aes(x = height, y = mass)) +
  facet_grid(. ~ gender) +  # or use rows/cols argument
  geom_point() +
  labs(title = "Mass vs. height of Starwars characters",
       subtitle = "Faceted by gender")  
```

* Describe what each plot displays.
* Think about how the code relates to the output.

```{r out.width="90%", warning=FALSE}
ggplot(data = starwars, mapping = aes(x = height, y = mass)) +
  geom_point() +
  facet_grid(gender ~ .)
```


```{r out.width="95%", warning=FALSE}
ggplot(data = starwars, mapping = aes(x = height, y = mass)) +
  geom_point() +
  facet_wrap(~ eye_color)
```

Let us facet species:

```{r}
# Your turn - Finish the code
ggplot(data = starwars, mapping = aes(x = height, y = mass)) +
  geom_point() +
  facet_wrap(~ species)
```


**Summary**

- `facet_grid()`:
    - 2d grid
    - `rows ~ cols`
    - use `.` for no split
- `facet_wrap()`: 1d ribbon wrapped into 2d



## Identifying variables and plot type

- Univariate data analysis - distribution of single variable
- Bivariate data analysis - relationship between two variables
- Multivariate data analysis - relationship between many variables at once, usually focusing on the relationship between two while conditioning for others

There are different variable types:

- **Numerical variables** can be classified as **continuous** or **discrete** based on whether or not the variable can take on an infinite number of values or only non-negative whole numbers, respectively.
- If the variable is **categorical**, we can determine if it is **ordinal** based on whether or not the levels have a natural ordering.

## Visualizing numerical data

Describing shapes of numerical distributions

- shape:
    - skewness: right-skewed, left-skewed, symmetric (skew is to the side of the longer tail)
    - modality: unimodal, bimodal, multimodal, uniform
- center: mean (`mean`), median (`median`), mode (not always useful)
- spread: range (`range`), standard deviation (`sd`), inter-quartile range (`IQR`)
- unusal observations


### Histograms

```{r out.width="75%"}
ggplot(data = starwars, mapping = aes(x = height)) +
  geom_histogram(binwidth = 10)
```


### Density plots

```{r out.width="75%"}
ggplot(data = starwars, mapping = aes(x = height)) +
  geom_density()
```



## Visualizing categorical data

### Bar plots

```{r out.width="80%"}
ggplot(data = starwars, mapping = aes(x = gender)) +
  geom_bar()
```


### Segmented bar plots, counts

```{r out.width="80%"}
ggplot(data = starwars, mapping = aes(x = gender, fill = hair_color)) +
  geom_bar()
```


Let us recode hair color into a smaller set:

```{r}
starwars <- starwars %>%
  mutate(hair_color2 = 
           fct_other(hair_color, 
                     keep = c("black", "brown", "brown", "blond")
                     )
         )
```

The segmented bar plot now becomes

```{r out.width="70%"}
# Your turn - Finish the code
# ggplot(data = starwars, 
#        mapping = aes(x = gender, fill = ___)) +
#   geom_bar() +
#   coord_flip()

ggplot(data = starwars, aes(x = gender, fill = hair_color2)) +
  geom_bar() +
  coord_flip()
```

Try to run the following:

```{r out.width="70%"}
ggplot(data = starwars, 
       mapping = aes(x = gender, fill = hair_color2)) +
  geom_bar(position = "fill") +
  coord_flip() +
  labs(y = "proportion")
```

Which bar plot is a more useful representation for visualizing the relationship between gender and hair color?



## Visualizing relationships between numerical and categorical data

### Side-by-side box plots

```{r out.width="75%", warning=FALSE}
ggplot(data = starwars, mapping = aes(y = height, x = gender)) +
  geom_boxplot()
```

### Scatter plot...

This is not a great representation of these data.

```{r out.width="60%", warning=FALSE}
ggplot(data = starwars, mapping = aes(y = height, x = gender)) +
  geom_point()
```


### Violin plots

```{r out.width="75%", warning=FALSE}
ggplot(data = starwars, mapping = aes(y = height, x = gender)) +
  geom_violin()
```


### Jitter plot

```{r echo=FALSE}
set.seed(1234)
```

```{r out.width="75%", warning=FALSE}
ggplot(data = starwars, mapping = aes(y = height, x = gender)) +
  geom_jitter()
```

What does `geom_gitter` do? 

*Jitter is simply a normal scatter plot (geom_point) where some random noice is introduced. This ensures that points that are on top of each other are more easily visible, i.e. it allows to better interpret the density of the number of points in an area.*

### Scatterplot as columns

What is the average height for each species?

```{r}
dat <- starwars %>%
  group_by(species) %>% 
  summarise(avg = mean(height, na.rm = T))
dat
```

Let us visualize it

```{r}
dat %>% ggplot(aes(x = species, y = avg)) + 
  geom_col()
```
Let us sort the columns, add labels and rotate the x-axis labels:

```{r}
dat %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x = reorder(species, avg), y = avg)) + 
  geom_col() + 
  labs(title = "Average height of each species",
       x = "Species",
       y = "Avg. height"
    ) +
  theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 90, vjust = 0.5, hjust=1))
```


## Visualizing relationships between numerical and numerical data

### Scatterplot

```{r}
starwars_without_jabba <- starwars %>% filter(mass < 500)
```

```{r out.width="75%", warning=FALSE}
ggplot(starwars_without_jabba, aes(x = height, y = mass)) +
  geom_point()
```

Let us try to add some lines

```{r}
ggplot(starwars_without_jabba, aes(x = height, y = mass)) +
  geom_point() +
  geom_smooth() +  # smooth trend line
  geom_smooth(method = "lm", color = "red") # linear regression line
```
