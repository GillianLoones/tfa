## Introduction

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a *simple formatting syntax* for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>. When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. 

Help links:

- For Markdown basics see **Help > Markdown Quick Reference** in RStudio.
- For R Markdown basics see the **Help > Cheatsheets > R Markdown Cheat Sheet** in RStudio.
- To see the possible options for R chunks see <https://yihui.org/knitr/options/>.

You may download the [source on GitHub](https://github.com/bss-osca/tfa/blob/master/slides/03-transform/03-transform_examples.Rmd) using 

```{r, eval=FALSE}
# setwd(dirname(rstudioapi::getActiveDocumentContext()$path))  # set working dir to current file location
url <- "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/bss-osca/tfa/master/slides/03-transform/03-transform_examples.Rmd"
download.file(url, 
              "03-transform_ex.Rmd",   # stores file in R working directory
              mode="w")                # "w" means "write," and is used for text files
```


## Input and output 

We load the following packages:

```{r message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
library(tidyverse)
# devtools::install_github("bss-osca/tfa/tfa-package", dependencies = FALSE)  # so have the latest version
library(tfa)
```

Let us load the _hotels_ dataset located in the tfa package 

```{r}
csv_file <- system.file("extdata/hotels.csv", package = "tfa")  # path to file
lines <- read_lines(csv_file, n_max = 3)
cat(lines, sep = "\n")
```

It seems that the delimiter is a `,` and we may try to read the file using `read_csv`:

```{r, message=FALSE}
hotels <- read_csv(csv_file)
hotels
```

Let us create two datasets:

```{r}
dat1 <- hotels %>% filter(hotel == "Resort Hotel") %>% head()
dat2 <- hotels %>% filter(hotel == "City Hotel") %>% head()
dat2 
```

Now save these two datasets as csv files:

```{r}
file1 <- "test1.csv"
file2 <- "test2.csv"
# Your turn: finish the code (5 min, including the two next chunks)
# write_csv(___)
# ___
```

Let us add the two datasets to a list and save the list as a binary RDS file:

```{r}
dat <- list(hotel1 = dat1, hotel2 = dat2)
# Your turn: finish the code 
# saveRDS(___)
```

You can test by removing all objects and load the object again

```{r}
rm(list=ls())
# Your turn: finish the code 
# readRDS(___)
# dat
```


## Transform using dplyr

We load the *hotels* dataset:

```{r}
library(skimr)
csv_file <- system.file("extdata/hotels.csv", package = "tfa")  # path to file
hotels <- read_csv(csv_file) 
glimpse(hotels)
skim(hotels)
# or use View(hotels) to see a spreadsheet-style data viewer # only works in RStudio (commnented out for reproducability).
```

A definition of all variables/columns is given in the [Data dictionary](#data-dir) section at the end, though you don't need to familiarize yourself with all variables.


Let us try different functions:

### Select a single column

View only the `lead_time` type (number of days between booking and arrival date):

```{r}
hotels %>% select(lead_time) # select(hotels, lead_time) without pipe. Pipe is convenient and good practice though.
```

Note that 

   - The function is a verb: `select()`
   - We use the pipe operator (Ctrl+Shift+M). `hotels` is passed as the first argument to `select`
   - We select the column with name `lead_time`
   - The result is a data frame with 119,300 rows and 1 column: dplyr functions always 
   expect a data frame and always yield a data frame.

### Select multiple columns

View only the `hotel` type and `lead_time`:

```{r}
hotels %>% select(hotel, lead_time)
```

What if we wanted to select these columns, and then arrange the data in descending order of lead time?


```{r}
hotels %>%
  select(hotel, lead_time) %>% 
  arrange(desc(lead_time))
```


### The pipe operator

Note that we use the pipe `%>%` operator. This means you "pipe" the output of the previous line of code as the first input of the next line of code. To give an example think about the following sequence of actions: find key, 
unlock car, start car, drive to work, park. Expressed as a set of nested functions in R pseudocode this would look like:

```{r eval=FALSE}
park(drive(start_car(find("keys")), to = "work"))
```

Writing it out using pipes give it a more natural (and easier to read) 
structure:
```{r eval=FALSE}
find("keys") %>%
  start_car() %>%
  drive(to = "work") %>%
  park()
```



### Different uses of `select`

Exclude variable/column `agent`:

```{r}
hotels %>%
  select(-agent)
```

Select a range of variables:

```{r}
hotels %>%
  select(hotel:arrival_date_month) 
```

**Select helpers**

- `starts_with()`: Starts with a prefix
- `ends_with()`: Ends with a suffix
- `contains()`: Contains a literal string
- `num_range()`: Matches a numerical range like x01, x02, x03
- `one_of()`: Matches variable names in a character vector
- `everything()`: Matches all variables
- `last_col()`: Select last variable, possibly with an offset
- `matches()`: Matches a regular expression (a sequence of symbols/characters expressing a string/pattern to be searched for within text)

See help for any of these functions for more info, e.g. `?everything`. Some examples are given below.

Columns that starts with "arrival":

```{r}
hotels %>%
  select(starts_with("arrival")) 
```

Columns that ends with "type":

```{r}
# Your turn: finish the code (2 min, including all the chunks in this section)
# hotels %>%
#   select(___) 

hotels %>% 
  select(ends_with("type"))
```

Columns that contains "date":

```{r}
# Your turn: finish the code 
# hotels %>%
#   select(___) 

hotels %>% 
  select(contains("date"))
```


### `arrange` in ascending / descending order

Use `arrange` to sort/order/arrange rows:

```{r}
hotels %>%
  select(adults, children, babies) %>%
  arrange(babies)
```

```{r}
hotels %>%
  select(adults, children, babies) %>%
  arrange(desc(babies), desc(children)) 
```


### `slice` for certain rows

Use `slice` to extract certain rows.

First five:

```{r}
hotels %>%
  slice_head(n = 5) 
```

Last four:

```{r}
hotels %>%
  slice_tail(n = 4) 
```

Maximum values:

```{r}
hotels %>%
  select(adults, children, babies) %>%
  slice_max(children, n = 4, with_ties = FALSE) 
```



### `filter` a subset of rows 

Use `filter` to find a subset of the rows.

Bookings in City Hotel:

```{r}
hotels %>%
  filter(hotel == "City Hotel") 
```

Logical operators in R:

operator    | definition                   | | operator     | definition
------------|------------------------------|-|--------------|----------------
`<`         | less than                    | |`x`\|`y`      | `x` OR `y` 
`<=`        | less than or equal to        | |`is.na(x)`    | test if `x` is `NA`
`>`         | greater than                 | |`!is.na(x)`   | test if `x` is not `NA`
`>=`        | greater than or equal to     | |`x %in% y`    | test if `x` is in `y`
`==`        | exactly equal to             | |`!(x %in% y)` | test if `x` is not in `y`
`!=`        | not equal to                 | |`!x`          | not `x`
`x & y`     | `x` AND `y`                  | |              |

Bookings with only children:

```{r}
hotels %>%
  filter( 
    adults == 0,     
    children >= 1    
    ) %>% 
  select(adults, babies, children)
```

Bookings with no adults and some children or babies in the room:

```{r}

hotels %>%
  filter( 
    adults == 0,     
    children >= 1 | babies >= 1     
    ) %>%
  select(adults, babies, children)
```

Are people traveling on a whim? Let's see... 

Fill in the blanks for filtering hotel bookings where the guest is **not** 
from the US (`country` code `"USA"`) and the `lead_time` is less than 1 day.

```{r}
# Your turn: finish the code (5 min, including all the chunks in this section)
# hotels %>%
#   filter(
#     country ____ "USA", 
#     lead_time ____ ____
#     )

hotels %>% 
  filter(country != "USA", 
         lead_time < 1)
```

How many bookings involve at least 1 child **or** baby?

```{r}
# Your turn: finish the code
# hotels %>%
#   filter(
#     children [AT LEAST] 1 [OR] babies [AT LEAST] 1
#     )

hotels %>% 
  filter(children > 1 | babies > 1)
```

Do you think it's more likely to find bookings with children or babies in city 
hotels or resort hotels? Test your intuition. Using `filter()` determine the 
number of bookings in resort hotels that have more than 1 child **or** baby 
in the room? 

```{r}
# Your turn: finish the code
# pay attention to correctness and code style

hotels %>% 
  filter(hotel == "Resort Hotel", 
         children > 1 | babies > 1)
# 1655 bookings
```

Then, do the same for city hotels, and compare the numbers of 
rows in the resulting filtered data frames.

```{r}
# Your turn: finish the code
# pay attention to correctness and code style

hotels %>% 
  filter(hotel == "City Hotel", 
         children > 1 | babies > 1)
# 2091 bookings
```

[Add you comment here] -- City Hotels have more bookings with children or babies. This goes against intuition I suppose. Although, contrary to the assignment, I'd look at *at least* 1 child or baby (>=). Which maybe gives the more intuitive result.


### `distinct` to filter for unique rows

... and `arrange` to order alphabetically

```{r}
hotels %>% 
  distinct(market_segment) %>% 
  arrange(market_segment)
```



```{r}
hotels %>% 
  distinct(hotel, market_segment) %>% 
  arrange(hotel, market_segment)
```




### `count` to create frequency tables

```{r}
# alphabetical order by default
hotels %>%
  count(market_segment) 
```

```{r}
# descending frequency order
hotels %>%
  count(market_segment, sort = TRUE) 
```

Create a frequency table of the number of `adults` in a booking. Display the 
results in descending order so the most common observation is on top.

```{r}
# Your turn: finish the code (1 min)
# pay attention to correctness and code style

hotels %>% 
  count(adults, sort = TRUE)
```

What is the most common number of adults in bookings in this dataset? Are there any 
surprising results? 

[Your comment here] -- 2 adults is most common. Not surprising (couples). 0 adult bookings could be surprising.


### `count` for multiple variables

```{r}
hotels %>%
  count(hotel, market_segment) 
```

Create a frequency table for canceled bookings and adults (`is_canceled` coded as 1) and 
once for not canceled bookings (`is_canceled` coded as 0). 

```{r}
# Your turn: finish the code (1 min)
# pay attention to correctness and code style

hotels %>% 
  filter(is_canceled == 1) %>% 
  count(adults)

hotels %>% 
  filter(is_canceled == 0) %>% 
  count(adults)
```

What does this reveal of surprising results?

[Your comment here] -- Not really surprising. Couples cancel a lot, but also book a lot.



### `mutate` to add a new variable

```{r}
hotels %>%
  mutate(little_ones = children + babies) %>% 
  select(children, babies, little_ones) %>%
  arrange(desc(little_ones))
```

Little ones in resort and city hotels:

```{r}
# Resort Hotel
hotels %>%
  mutate(little_ones = children + babies) %>%
  filter(
    little_ones >= 1,
    hotel == "Resort Hotel"
    ) %>%
  select(hotel, little_ones)
```

```{r}
# City Hotel
hotels %>%
  mutate(little_ones = children + babies) %>%
  filter(
    little_ones > 1,
    hotel == "City Hotel"
    )  %>%
  select(hotel, little_ones)
```

What is happening in the following chunk?

```{r}
hotels %>%
  mutate(little_ones = children + babies) %>%
  count(hotel, little_ones) %>%
  mutate(prop = n / sum(n))
```


### `summarise` for summary stats

```{r}
# mean average daily rate for all bookings
hotels %>%
  summarise(mean_adr = mean(adr)) 
```

Note `summarise()` changes the data frame entirely, it collapses rows down to a single 
summary statistics, and removes all columns that are irrelevant to the calculation.


### `group_by` for grouped operations

```{r}
# mean average daily rate for all booking at city and resort hotels
hotels %>%
  group_by(hotel) %>% 
  summarise(mean_adr = mean(adr))
```

Note `count` is simply short for `group_by` then determine frequencies 


```{r}
hotels %>%
  group_by(hotel) %>%
  summarise(n = n())
```

```{r}
hotels %>%
  count(hotel)
```

`summarise` can be used for multiple summary statistics as well

```{r}
hotels %>%
  summarise(
    min_adr = min(adr),
    mean_adr = mean(adr),
    median_adr = median(adr),
    max_adr = max(adr)
    )
```

Calculate minimum, mean, median, and maximum average daily rate (`adr`) grouped 
by `hotel` type so that you can get these statistics separately for resort and 
city hotels. Which type of hotel is higher, on average? 

```{r}
# Your turn: finish the code (5 min, including all the chunks in this section)
# pay attention to correctness and code style

hotels %>% 
  group_by(hotel) %>% 
  summarise(
         min_adr = min(adr), 
         mean_adr = mean(adr), 
         median_adr = median(adr), 
         max_adr = max(adr),
         ) 
```

We observe two unusual values in the summary statistics above (a negative 
minimum, and a very high maximum). What types of hotels are these? Locate 
these observations in the dataset and find out the arrival date (year and 
month) as well as how many people (adults, children, and babies) stayed in 
the room. 

**Hint:** For example, you can `filter` for the given `adr` amounts and 
`select` the relevant columns.

```{r}
# Your turn: finish the code 
# pay attention to correctness and code style

# My solution
hotels %>% 
  slice_max(adr) %>% 
  select(adr, 
         arrival_date_year, arrival_date_month, 
         adults, children, babies)

hotels %>% 
  slice_min(adr) %>% 
  select(adr, 
         arrival_date_year, arrival_date_month, 
         adults, children, babies)

# Teacher solution
hotels %>% 
  filter(adr < -6.35 | adr > 5399) %>% 
  select(adr, 
         arrival_date_year, arrival_date_month, 
         adults, children, babies)
```




## Data dictionary {#data-dir}

Below is the full data dictionary. Note that it is long (there are lots of 
variables in the data), but we will be using a limited set of the variables 
for our analysis.
